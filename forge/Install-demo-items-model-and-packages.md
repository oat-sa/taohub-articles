Install demo items model and packages
=====================================

This files contained in this archive will be used during the IAEA 2013 conference in Tel Aviv. Please simply download the archives on your machine prior to the workshop.\
The files to download are:

1.  The [Sample Item package](resources/http://forge.taotesting.com/attachments/download/2621/TAO%202.5%20Sample%20item%20package.zip) containing the RDF files for the folder hierarchy and the sample items packages.
2.  The [QTI demonstration test package](resources/http://forge.taotesting.com/attachments/download/2623/DEMO-TEST-QUESTIFY-TEST.zip) to import (obtained as an export from another QTI compliant tool).

A comprehensive tutorial about how to import a folder hierarchy model for items, the item packages associated to these folders and a complete QTI test package will be proposed here soon.
