Processes
=========

![](../resources/processes-tabs1.png)

The Processes extension manages the processes creation.\
The Processes extension allows creating processes, in a tutorial goal for example.\
This extension also manages the roles creation, the association of the selected role to user(s), and manages users (creation, modification and deletion).\
The Processes extension installation leads eight new sections (six sections are in the Processes extension, one in Test extension, one in Deliveries extension).
