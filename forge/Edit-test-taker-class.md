Edit test taker class
=====================

![](resources/testtakers-editclass.png)

The Edit test taker class pane is displayed when a class is selected in the Test takers library.

Here you can add, edit or delete the properties of a class.

By default, some properties are predefined, as they constitute the specification of a test taker: First name, Last name, Login, Mail, Default language, Interface language, Old password, New password and Repeat new password. They can’t be edited or deleted.

You can add different type of properties: a short text, a date, a multiple choice list, etc.

-\> For advanced users: you can create properties from widgets and all resources available on the platform (model, literal, container, etc.) in the Advanced mode.
