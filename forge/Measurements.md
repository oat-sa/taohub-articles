Measurements
============

introduced in [[TAO 2 2|TAO 2.2]]

Measurements allow us to describe the variables that will be created during the delivery of the item. This functionality allows the extension [[taoCoding]] to give additional informations to the graders on how to evaluate the test-takers answers.

Generation
----------

### QTI Items

Using the outpoutVariables declaration we generate the measurements automatically.

### Open Wep Items (todo)

Informations concerning the measurements cannot yet be provided, but could be gathered in a manifest at a later stage.

### Visualisation/Authoring (todo)
