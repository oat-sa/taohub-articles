Event Based Scoring Mechanism
=============================

1. Objective
------------

The current characteristics of the common scoring mechanism are:

-   The definition of the scoring rule during the item building phase
-   A direct comparison between the given answer and the expected one
-   The value of the score is set just after passing the test
-   We do not get the strategy used by the test taker

Currently, we need more and more:

-   TO find the possibility to define scoring rules after the building item phase
-   A possibility to calculate the score values at several levels of the process
-   Manage the Problem Solving assessment, (the strategy is more important than the final answer)

The main objective of EBS is summarized in the following

-   How to get the used strategy to resolve the problem in the item?
-   How to express the pattern of strategies to score them?
-   How to use the returned value of the score in formative assessment approach (feedback)?
-   How to analyze and use the result a long time after taking the test?

2. Description
--------------

Three main tasks have to be implemented to ensure the event based scoring. See the Figure below
