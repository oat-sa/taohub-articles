Install demo items model and packages
=====================================

This files contained in this archive will be used during the IAEA 2013 conference in Tel Aviv. Please simply download the archives on your machine prior to the workshop.<br/>

The files to download are:

1.  The [Sample Item package](http://forge.taotesting.com/attachments/download/2621/TAO%202.5%20Sample%20item%20package.zip) containing the RDF files for the folder hierarchy and the sample items packages.
2.  The [QTI demonstration test package](http://forge.taotesting.com/attachments/download/2623/DEMO-TEST-QUESTIFY-TEST.zip) to import (obtained as an export from another QTI compliant tool).

A comprehensive tutorial about how to import a folder hierarchy model for items, the item packages associated to these folders and a complete QTI test package will be proposed here soon.
