Mobile TAO Focus Group
======================

The goal of this focus group is to coordinate the testing of Mobile Delivery Support in TAO. This focus group will setup multiple beta testing sessions in order to gather information about a wide range of mobile devices/operating systems.

-   [OrderInteraction](resources/http://www.imsglobal.org/question/qtiv2p1/imsqti_infov2p1.html#element10283)
-   [AssociateInteraction](resources/http://www.imsglobal.org/question/qtiv2p1/imsqti_infov2p1.html#element10291)

Process
-------

The Mobile TAO Focus Group will engage an iterative process. Each iteration will be composed of multiple steps.

1.  **Implementation** of mobile support for a targeted subset of QTI Interactions.
2.  **Beta-testing** of already implemented interactions.
3.  **Collect** of issues/remarks among focus group members.

We would like to support as most interactions as we can at the end of these iterations.
