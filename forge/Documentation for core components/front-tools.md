Front tools
===========

**These tools *are not required* to run TAO, but can be helpful for client side development.**

Grunt
-----

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) helps you to automate tasks like require.js optimization, SASS compiling, test running, code linting, etc.

Grunt runs on node.js, so you need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed (node >= 4.0.0) and running.

- For Linux user, you could install it easily node from a native package using [nodesource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions)

    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

- If you want node only for your user, you can install it using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.1/install.sh | bash
    nvm install v6.2.1
    nvm alias default v6.2.1

- Then to install and set up Grunt :

    cd tao/views
    npm install

Then you should be able to see available grunt tasks from the `tao/views` directory:

    grunt --help
