# Calculator component overview

> A calculator component is provided by TAO. This article explains how it works.

**Note:** The calculator has been refactored with the internal engine extracted and moved to a dedicated repository. For TAO before release `2023.06`, please look at the [previous documentation](https://github.com/oat-sa/taohub-articles/commit/93fd085f4f00bd70976e63dc81d28e6962763f53).

TAO provides three different calculators:

-   a basic 4-functions [calculator implementation](https://github.com/oat-sa/tao-core-ui-fe/blob/master/src/calculator.js),

![basic calculator](../../resources/frontend/calculator/calculator-basic.png)

-   a [BODMAS version](https://github.com/oat-sa/tao-core-ui-fe/blob/master/src/maths/calculator/basicCalculator.js), functioning according to the BODMAS rules,

![BODMAS calculator](../../resources/frontend/calculator/calculator-bodmas.png)

-   a [scientific version](https://github.com/oat-sa/tao-core-ui-fe/blob/master/src/maths/calculator/scientificCalculator.js), for solving science, engineering, and mathematical problems.

![scientific calculator](../../resources/frontend/calculator/calculator-scientific.png)

The basic 4-functions calculator is made with a simple implementation where operations are computed as they come. It immediately computes the operation, without taking into account the precedence of operators.

In order to properly support the [mathematical order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BODMAS), we designed another calculator component. Instead of immediately computing the new value it uses expressions. This way the user is able to build a complex operation before executing it. The mathematical order is respected, for instance `*` and `/` are computed before `+` and `-`, and parenthesis are available to change priorities: `3*(2+1)` will not give the same result as `3*2+1`.

To process the expression a parser is bundled with the calculator component. Mathematical precision is handled by an
[arbitrary precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) library which avoid the well known [round-off issue](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html). However, some precision issues may still occur, especially when dealing with irrational values.

## Computation engine

The computation engine is defined and implemented by an external package: [`@oat-sa/tao-calculator`](https://github.com/oat-sa/tao-calculator-fe). It relies on several third-party components: a parser, a number representation engine, and a lexer is used to tokenize the expression.

## Events model

The calculator is a complex and extensible component. It relies on several
mechanisms to perform its job, and one of those mechanisms is the events model:
the calculator is heavily relying on events to communicate.

A detailed explanation on how events model is implemented can be found in the
[Events model](../events-model.md) page.

## Component abstraction

From the outside, the calculator can be seen as a UI component. In fact, it is
composed of several pieces, some of them, the visual ones, are actually UI
components, while some others are not.

UI components are built on top of a [component abstraction](../component-abstraction.md),
controlled by a core module exposing a factory function. This abstraction relies on
delegation pattern, augmenting the default API by linking a specifications object
to the created instance. It also integrates the `eventifier` API, giving to any
components the ability to communicate through events.

## Plugins model

The calculator main component is only exposing API. Most of its features are supplied by sub-components, represented either by the internal engine or by plugins.

A detailed explanation on how plugins model is implemented can be found in the
[Plugins model](../plugins-model.md) page.

## Architecture overview

The calculator is built using a modularized architecture, heavily relying on
events to communicate between each parts, and a system of plugins to easily
extends its behavior and features.

The following schema shows a global overview of the modules composing the
calculator. Three main areas are identified here:

-   the core area, that contains the engine part of the calculator
-   the components area, that contains the UI components a client can integrate
-   the plugins area, that contains the modules that implement or extend the
    features of the calculator

![global overview](../../resources/frontend/calculator/calculator-overview.png)

While the internal mechanisms are built inside the core engine, the visual
features are provided by plugins and top level components. Those points will be
discussed in the following sections.

## Core architecture

Before having a look on the top level components, let's discuss about the core
architecture of the calculator. The calculator's engine is composed by several
modules, mostly related to the expressions handling. A plugins system is also
applied to allow to extend the features easily, this is also the chosen way to
bring the UI on top of the calculator.

![core overview](../../resources/frontend/calculator/calculator-core-overview.png)

The main component, the calculator `board`, is gathering the computation engine
and a system of plugins, exposing an API to access and manipulate the
expression. It also embeds and exposes an area broker, giving access to the
display layout. However, the layout is empty by design, and it is only a
group of placeholders where the UI plugins will place their visual components.
In other words, the `board` can be seen as an abstract component.

Events model is the core concept allowing to communicate with the calculator
`board`, but a particular mechanism has also been built in to interact with the
expression: the commands layer.

### Commands layer

The commands layer is built on top of the events model, as it relies on events
to trigger each command. A strong difference though, with standard events,
should be mentioned: commands have to be registered, otherwise an error event
will be emitted when a client will try to use them.

Commands are the recommended way to add behavior on the calculator, as they
provide a particular meaning. Each plugins can then expose their particular
commands, or link to existing ones. The calculator `board` is also defining
standard commands, like the general purpose cleaning commands or the execute
computation one. The list of known commands will be detailed later in this doc.

### API

The calculator `board` is the main component, exposing the essential API to
manage the calculator and process to computations. However, by default nothing
is displayed, as it focuses on the engine layer. Display and other fancy stuff
are delegated to plugins, which are using the events and the API to allow the
user to interact with the component. The `board` is an abstract component.

#### calculator board factory

The entry point to this calculator `board` is its factory function:
`calculatorBoardFactory($container, plugins, config)`, that returns an instance
of the component.

-   `$container`: The first parameter is the DOM container in which the component
    will be rendered. This is mandatory since the area broker component requires
    access to the rendered layout, and the plugins system do need a valid area
    broker. So the component is immediately rendered during the initialization
    process. `$` indicates `jQuery`, it should therefore be represented by a
    `jQuery` Object.
-   `plugins`: The second parameter is a collection of plugins factories. It could
    be empty, but the MVP is lead by plugins, so the `board` component won't
    directly bring user interactions without them.
-   `config`: The third parameter allows to setup the `board`, by providing a
    config descriptor. - `expression`: the initial expression to work on, default none - `position`: the position in the initial expression, default 0 - `maths`: additional config to forward to the `mathsEvaluator` function - `plugins`: config for each plugins, indexed by names of plugin

##### component overview

Since the calculator `board` is a UI component, it inherits from the standard
component API. And as any components is also an event emitter, hence it inherits
from the `eventifier` mixin.

The `board` component supplies its own business API, and also produces some
changes on the default component behavior. Among other appended API, some
noteworthy differences from the default implementation are listed here.

###### `init(config)`

The component initialization method. It should not be called directly, as it is
for internal purpose. The `board` factory is calling it while building the
instance. The important thing to know is this initialization is deferred, so
the component is not immediately available. However, that allows to listen to
the `init` event to be able to extend the initialization process.

> Emits the `init` event, once config initialized, but before any rendering
> process.

###### `render(container)`

Renders the component in the provided container. The calculator `board` is
automatically calling this method, so it should not be called directly. The
`board` component also initializes plugins a this stage.

**Note**: this is a life cycle method, and must not be called more than one
time. The _update_ of the component has to be managed by the component itself.
The `board` component is taking care of this.

> Emits the `render` event, as well as the `ready` event when all plugins are in
> place and the component is ready to work. The `"rendered"` state is also set.

###### `getExpression()`

Returns the current expression.

###### `setExpression(expression)`

Changes the current expression.

> Emits the `expressionchange` event, with the new expression as parameter.

###### `getPosition()`

Gets the current position inside the expression.

###### `setPosition(position)`

Sets the current position inside the expression. The value is constrained to the
limits of the current expression.

> Emits the `positionchange` event, with the new position as parameter.

###### `getTokens()`

Gets the tokens from the current expression. Applies the internal tokenizer on
the expression if needed. The result is put in local cache till the next change
applied on the expression.

###### `getToken()`

Gets the token at the current position from the current expression. Applies the
internal tokenizer on the expression if needed.

###### `getTokenIndex()`

Gets token index from the current position in the expression. Applies the
internal tokenizer on the expression if needed.

###### `getTokenizer()`

Gets access to the tokenizer.

###### `getVariable(name)`

Gets a variable defined for the expression. The returned value is a
`mathsExpression` descriptor.

###### `hasVariable(name)`

Checks if a variable is registered.

###### `setVariable(name, value)`

Sets a variable that can be used by the expression. The value will be casted to
a `mathsExpression` descriptor.

> Emits the `variableadd` event, with the name and the value as parameters.

###### `deleteVariable(name)`

Deletes a variable defined for the expression.

> Emits the `variabledelete` event, with the name as parameter.

###### `getVariables()`

Gets the list of variables defined for the expression. Returns an object indexed
by variables names.

###### `setVariables(variables)`

Sets a list of variables that can be used by the expression. The `variables`
parameter is an object indexed by variables names.

> Emits the `variableadd` event for each add, with the name and the value as
> parameters.

###### `deleteVariables()`

Deletes all variables defined for the expression.

> Emits the `variabledelete` event, providing `null` as parameter. The variable
> used to store the last result is reset to `0`, and the `variableadd` event will
> also be emitted.

###### `setLastResult(result)`

Sets the value of the last result. The targeted variable is `ans`. If the value
is missing, or contains any errors, it will be replaced by a `0`.

> Emits the `variableadd` event.

###### `getLastResult()`

Gets the value of the last result. The returned value is a `mathsExpression`
descriptor.

###### `setCommand(name, label, description)`

Registers a command.

> Emits the `commandadd` event with the name as parameter.

###### `getCommand(name)`

Gets the definition of a registered command. The returned value is an object
containing the following properties: `name`, `label`, `description`.

###### `getCommands()`

Gets the list of registered commands. The returned value is an object indexed by
names.

###### `hasCommand(name)`

Checks if a command is registered.

###### `deleteCommand(name)`

Delete a registered command.

> Emits the `commanddelete` event, with the name as parameter.

###### `addTerm(name, term)`

Inserts a term in the expression at the current position. The `name` of the term
should be the identifier of a token, like `NUM0` or `SQRT`. The `term` itself
should be a `term` descriptor, say an object containing at least the following
properties: `type`, `value`, `label`. This method takes care of the meaning of
the added term, ensuring it does not break the expression by wrapping with
spaces if needed. It also apply some business logic regarding the existing
expression, it will replace it if:

-   it is a 0, and the term to add is not an operator nor a dot
-   it is the last result, and the term to add is not an operator.

> Emits the `termerror` event if the term to add is invalid.

> Emits the `termadd` event when the term has been added, and then emits the
> `termadd-<name>` event, `<name>` being replaced by the name of the term.

###### `useTerm(name)`

Inserts a term in the expression at the current position. The provided name
should exist in the collection of registered terms, defined in the `terms`
module. The function to operator prefix `@` is supported, if the token is
prefixed with it, the inserted value will be too.

> Emits the `termerror` event if the term to add is invalid.

> Emits the `termadd` event when the term has been added, and then emits the
> `termadd-<name>` event, `<name>` being replaced by the name of the term.

###### `useTerms(names)`

Inserts a list of terms in the expression at the current position. The names of
the terms to insert could be either an array of names or a list separated by
spaces.

> For each term, emits the `termerror` event if the term to add is invalid.

> Emits the `termadd` event when the term has been added, and then emits the
> `termadd-<name>` event, `<name>` being replaced by the name of the term.

###### `useVariable(name)`

Inserts a variable as a term in the expression at the current position. The
variable is treated as a regular term, but the name is inflected in upper case
and prefixed with `VAR_`.

> Emits the `termerror` event if the term to add is invalid.

> Emits the `termadd` event when the term has been added, and then emits the
> `termadd-<name>` event, `<name>` being replaced by the name of the term.

###### `useCommand(name)`

Calls a command. Any additional parameters will be forwarded to the called
command.

> Emits the `commanderror` event if the command is invalid.
> Emits the `command` event, and then emits the `command-<name>` event,
> `<name>` being replaced by the name of the command. All command parameters are
> added to the event parameters.

###### `replace(newExpression, newPosition)`

Replaces the expression and set the position of the cursor. If the position is
not provided, just move the cursor at the end.

> Emits the `replace` event, with the old expression and position as parameters.

###### `insert(subExpression)`

Inserts a sub-expression in the current expression and move the cursor.

**Note**: the added expression is not checked.

> Emits the `insert` event, with the old expression and position as parameters.

###### `clear()`

> Emits the `syntaxerror` event if the expression contains an error.

> Emits the `evaluate` after the expression has been evaluated.

###### `runPlugins(method)`

Runs a method in all plugins. Returns a bundled `Promise`, that will resolve the
result of all calls.

###### `getPlugins()`

Gets the calculator plugins as an array.

###### `getPlugin(name)`

Gets a plugin by its name.

###### `getAreaBroker()`

Gets access to the areaBroker.

###### `setupMathsEvaluator()`

### Events

To have a clearer view, here is a summary of the standard events emitted by the
calculator `board` component.

#### Life-cycle events

These events are related to the component's life cycle.

| event     | description                                                                                                                      |

| `render`  | Emitted while the component is rendering. The DOM will be ready soon.                                                            |
| `ready`   | Emitted once the component has been rendered, and all plugins properly initialized. At this time the component is ready to work. |
| `error`   | Emitted when a general error occurs in the component.                                                                            |
| `destroy` | Emitted while the component is disposing its resources. It will be destroyed soon, and won't be available anymore.               |

#### Calculator events

Those events are related to the calculator's logic. However, this list only
covers the standard events emitted by the main component, and does not cover
the events managed by the plugins.

### Commands

Here is a summary of the standard commands exposed by the calculator `board`
component. This list only covers the standard commands directly registered by
the main component, and does not cover the commands managed by the plugins.

## Components

The main calculator's component, `board`, is only exposing the engine. In a
rough state it cannot directly interact with the user. Other components are
required to bring this ability.

![components overview](../../resources/frontend/calculator/calculator-components-overview.png)

The `board` component is an abstract component. With the addition of some
plugins it can be able to perform satisfying UI. However, it does not bring any
frameset. For that purpose, another abstract component is added: the
`calculatorComponent` wraps the `board` into a movable panel, and loads core
plugins, but still without any usable UI.

![components relationship](../../resources/frontend/calculator/calculator-component-relationship.png)

The `calculatorComponent` is loaded by another module, a factory function that
will load UI plugins, with default display: the `defaultCalculator`.

Then two other factories make use of this module, bringing proper templates.

-   `basicCalculator`: a basic [BODMAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BODMAS)
    calculator, providing basic arithmetic operations, with support of parenthesis.
    The components imports its own templates to properly display the expected
    features.
-   `scientificCalculator`: an advanced [BODMAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BODMAS)
    calculator, providing arithmetic, algebra and trigonometric operations.
    The components imports its own templates to properly display the expected
    features.

## Plugins

The main calculator component only exposes an engine, but it supports a plugin's
system to augment its abilities. Hence several features are brought by plugins.

By default, the calculator component does not display anything. This is why some
plugins are in charge to bring some user interface.

### templateKeyboard

Plugin that manages a keyboard for the calculator, with configurable layout.
Each displayed key must declare the target command, using DOM attributes:

-   `data-command`: The name of the command to call.
-   `data-param`: The optional parameter to apply to the command.

This plugin does not expose any command, but renders a layout that displays a
grid of buttons, each one targeting a particular command. The plugin listen to
button events, and then invoke the commands bound to those buttons.

The layout is configurable as it is provided as a template. To simplify the
rendering, the plugin give access to the shared labels as a template variable.

Here is a layout sample:

```html
<div class="calculator-keyboard">
    <div class="row">
        <button class="key operator" data-command="term" data-param="SQRT"><span>{{{labels.SQRT}}}</span></button>

### simpleScreen

Plugin that manages a simple screen for the calculator, with configurable layout.

This plugin does not expose any command, but renders a layout that displays the
current expression, as well as an history showing the last result and the last
computed expression.

It relies on the `tokens` helper to properly render the expression, taking care
of Maths symbols.

The layout is configurable as it is provided as a template.

Here is a layout sample:

```html
<div class="calculator-screen simple-screen">
    <div class="screen-panel history">{{{history}}}</div>
    <div class="screen-panel expression">{{{expression}}}</div>
</div>
```

## Known issues and drawbacks

Thanks to the numbers representation engine, the calculator is able to give a
good computation precision. However, due to the nature of computation, some known
issues are still there, and cannot be simply addressed.

### Loss of precision of inlined variables

Internally, the computed value have hundreds of decimal digits, and only a few is
displayed. So, if a variable is inlined, i.e. its displayed value is used instead
of the variable itself, the result won't be accurate. For instance, compute the
square root of 2. If you immediately elevate it at a power of 2, you will
retrieve the former value, said 2. However, if you take the displayed value and
elevate it to the power of 2, the result will be different, and could be
considered wrong if you expected to retrieve the former value.

### Loss of precision in some irrational numbers

Mathematically, it is impossible to have a bijective computation with the
inverse of 3: `1/3` gives `0.3333333333333`, and we can continue indefinitely
with the `3` after the decimal point. Now if you multiply this value by 3, no
matter the amount of `3` you will add after the decimal point, you will never
retrieve `1`, but `0.9999999999` instead. A mathematical trick is to add a `4`
as a last digit, but unfortunately this won't work with the calculator's engine.
In fact, it can only works by doing: `0.333333333 + 0.333333333 + 0.333333334`.
Which is not the same.
